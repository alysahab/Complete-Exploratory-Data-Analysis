# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) repository! This repository contains comprehensive guidance on conducting EDA for your data analysis projects.

## What is Exploratory Data Analysis?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in data analysis that involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often using visual methods. It helps analysts understand the data's underlying structure, detect patterns, and identify potential relationships between variables.

## Completing the EDA Process

The EDA process typically consists of the following stages:

### Data Sourcing

Understanding where and how to obtain data is crucial for any analysis. Proper data sourcing ensures that the collected data is relevant, reliable, and suitable for analysis. 

### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning involves preprocessing the dataset to handle inconsistencies, errors, and missing values. Key steps in data cleaning include:

- **Handling Missing Values:** Strategies to address missing data points.
- **Standardization of the Data:** Ensuring consistency and comparability of data across different variables.
- **Outlier Treatment:** Identifying and addressing outliers that may skew analysis results.
- **Handling Invalid Values:** Dealing with invalid or erroneous data entries.

### Data Analysis

After cleaning the data, analysts proceed to explore and analyze its characteristics. This involves understanding the types of data and selecting appropriate analytical methods:

- **Types of Data:** Understanding qualitative and quantitative data types.
- **Type of Analysis:** Exploring various analytical approaches, including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

### Derived Metrics

Derived metrics involve creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance analysis:

- **Feature Encoding:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for analysis.
- **Feature Binning:** Grouping numerical data into bins to simplify analysis and uncover patterns.
